      <description>A lot has happened since the latest devlog. Almost a year passed without an update. The pandemic and switching job kept my focus away from my side project, but I am finally back and keep pushing the limits. No new or left behind the project as promised! So let&amp;rsquo;s just jump in the code see what needs to change under the hood!
initial mistakes The initial code started without knowing exactly which state management fits my needs better, to be honest, I was experimenting a lot.</description>

      <description>My first app and first season!
The idea It takes a while to find a good niche on the app store, while I have been researching the field, I thought, it is a good idea to start building a tool for myself.
I needed a tool which lets me log my schedule and assign tasks to them. I have been using calendar and todo application to keep track my daily work in the office and day to day life but they felt so distant from each other.</description>

      <description>Revelation I hope one day I stop building other&amp;rsquo;s dream and start working on my own. to achieve that I decided I will pick up a few abandoned projects. Dust them off, and make it to the first release.
It was about time to start building towards my goals.
The plan Starting a project can never happen without a plan. This is one of the first rules that I made sure I follow.</description>
