<p>I hope one day I stop building other&rsquo;s dream and start working on my own. to achieve that I decided I will pick up a few abandoned projects. Dust them off, and make it to the first release.</p>
<p>It was about time to start building towards my goals.</p>
<h2 id="the-plan">The plan<a href="#the-plan" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Starting a project can never happen without a plan. This is one of the first rules that I made sure I follow. Don&rsquo;t start coding until there is a plan what is the expectation and the result.</p>
<p>Thankfully Github is perfect to keep everything in one place, for a project planning I stick to my engineering side and spin up a quick repository with a simple Kanban Project and sketch out my ideal V1 state.</p>
<p>Creating tickets helps me realise the time I have to allocate and spend on various tasks and I can plan forward with my time during the Year.<br>
No deadlines! I got enough of them on my day to day job, but seeing a green bar filling up with completed tasks is inspiring enough to keep pushing onward.</p>
<h2 id="milestones">Milestones<a href="#milestones" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>V1 releases are usually a significantly long stretch. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be crazy AAA level application, but software development is also a notable time investment. So milestones got introduced as a small batch of features or improvements as early releases like <code>v0.1.0</code>.</p>
<p>Milestones help me feel some accomplishment and keep me engaged on the topic even when life is happening. Plus, it enables me to showcase what I am currently working on and let others try out my app.</p>
<h2 id="before-we-code">Before we code<a href="#before-we-code" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Before writing code, I started linking CI/CD service, which turned out just amazing. I have learned a lot about  Github workflows and it helps a lot catching minor issues and consistency in my project.</p>
<p>The CD pipeline is an immense help with deployment. When I get questions about my progress I can easily show the app state or invite people to join as testers.</p>
<h2 id="devlog">devlog<a href="#devlog" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I stumble upon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ThinMatrix/">ThinMatrix</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUmLRMERmJrmUtgnbFfknAg">Randal</a>, and they gave me huge inspiration to start building something similar. Lately, I was looking into ways of podcasting anyhow and this would surely improve my writing and speaking skills. So, I will start creating my devlog and hope I will see you in the first season! 🙂</p>
