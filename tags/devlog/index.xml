      <description>My first app and first season!
The idea It takes a while to find a good niche on the app store, while I have been researching the field, I thought, it is a good idea to start building a tool for myself.
I needed a tool which lets me log my schedule and assign tasks to them. I have been using calendar and todo application to keep track my daily work in the office and day to day life but they felt so distant from each other.</description>

      <description>Revelation I hope one day I stop building other&amp;rsquo;s dream and start working on my own. to achieve that I decided I will pick up a few abandoned projects. Dust them off, and make it to the first release.
It was about time to start building towards my goals.
The plan Starting a project can never happen without a plan. This is one of the first rules that I made sure I follow.</description>
