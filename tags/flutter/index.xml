      <description>A lot has happened since the latest devlog. Almost a year passed without an update. The pandemic and switching job kept my focus away from my side project, but I am finally back and keep pushing the limits. No new or left behind the project as promised!

initial mistakes The initial code started without knowing exactly which state management fits my needs better, to be honest, I was experimenting a lot.</description>
