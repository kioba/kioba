## Career

  **May 2017 - Present: Freelancer Android Kotlin developer**  
  
  **Radio app :**  
I was working together with Makery at a radio streaming android app.  
We used clean architecture to build up the app with the help of Dagger2 dependency injection. The app was developed in pure Kotlin with Rxjava and Retrofit2. For the UI we used the XML ConstraintLayout. The streams were handled with the ExoPlayer2 library.

  **Jun 2016 - May 2017: Ustream an IBM company - C#/C++ Software Engineer**  
  Architect and develop a Windows desktop application(.Net framework) for camera and desktop live video streaming. My duty was to rework the existing architecture for supporting faster live video and audio frame handling and desktop capturing. The capture and frame transformation was handled with Microsoft Media Foundation. I introduced minor documentation, logging, crash analytics and laid down the base for Continuous Integration (CI), NuGet package management to make the development faster and the release process smoother. For multithreading and handling UI logic I introduced the reactive extension with Rx.NET.

**July 2013 - May 2016: Graphisoft SE - C/C++ Software Engineer**  
	   I was responsible for research and develop the cross platform (Windows & OSX) Graphical User Interface library with the GUI team for ARCHICAD which is used to design new buildings in 2D or 3D. Among the maintenance of the library I participated in planning for the future projects.
	   
Projects I participated:  
- Research and develop the new TabBar Widget [video link](https://youtu.be/kF__x0xJ7gc).  
- Develop a flat UI widget design system [video link](https://youtu.be/JVIlzxnnLmA).  
- Research and document the usage of the new SystemDialog on Windows Win32 system.  
- Research and develop High DPI scaling on Windows and research virtual coordinate system and conversion to Pixel coordinate system.
